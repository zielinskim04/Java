The WeatherAppProject was a project related to the completion of the course "Advanced Object-Oriented and Functional Programming" in the third semester of my studies. I worked on the project with Ada Wojterska https://github.com/wojterskaa. The application displays the current, historical, and future weather at a user-selected point on the world map. The app's functionalities include: showing the current weather, changing units, selecting a time range, dynamically changing charts, saving data to a PDF file, and showing the location of the selected place. Every time the user selects a point on the map, chooses the weather type, and sets the range, data is retrieved through an API request from https://open-meteo.com/. The name of the selected location is displayed using https://nominatim.org/. We used the Java component JMapViewer to display the map. The application template was Maven, and the graphical user interface was created with the Swing library.
